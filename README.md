# FRC_2023

The 2023 season was Charged Up, played on a 27-foot (8.2 m) by 54-foot (16 m) field 
covered with gray carpet. The field is surrounded by low polycarbonate walls on the long 
sides and taller Alliance Station walls on the short sides. The individual substations 
(part of the human player stations) on the long sides also feature a taller wall made 
of wire mesh panels.

The field is divided in half by a white line, with each half including one alliance's 
Community and the other alliance's Cargo Zone. The main scoring areas are the two 
communities (one per alliance), which are located near the alliance's two station walls. 
Robots begin the game completely contained within their alliance community. Each 
community includes a grid where game pieces can be recorded and a charging station 
where the robots can drive and maintain balance during the autonomous period and towards 
the end of the game.
